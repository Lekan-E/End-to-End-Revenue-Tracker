# End-to-End-Revenue-Tracker
### Business Task

Develop a dynamic dashboard to serve as a daily sales tracker for a bike-sharing company. This dashboard will allow stakeholders to track and compare daily rides, analyzing metrics such as total revenue generated, number of rides, and average revenue per ride. Users can apply dynamic filters to drill down into the data by member type, historical date, product/bike type, hour of the day, and most popular route. This will provide valuable insights into usage patterns and help optimize operational strategies.
